First, I used the statement:
       git grep "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information." `git show-ref --heads` 
       This statement found any instances of the phrase in the repository.
       This returned:
       beba17f43925823308c6f7f0d5ca9b52d00d351f:northamerica:# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
       refs/heads/master:northamerica:# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
       Meaning there were references found in the repository and that they were       in the master branch, in the file "northamerica". 

I then investigated further, using:
  git grep -n "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information." $(git rev-list --all)
  this showed me the exact line number that this phrase was written on: 890 

I then went to the file northamerica with the command 'emacs northamerica'
I then used the command C-s to search for the sentence "Even newspaper reports
  present contradictory information". Sure enough, the sentence was on line 890  as my search had told me
From reading the paragraphs before and after the statement, I conclude that
although the line is not cited in a very clear way, the contributor did indeed
copy the statemenet word for word and give credit to Shanks, the person who
wrote the statement originally.
